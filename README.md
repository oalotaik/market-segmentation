# Necessary Packages
Numpy + Pandas + Scikit-learn + Seaborn

# Motivation
This project is to show how to apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.

# Files
1. `Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb`: The jupyter notebook that contains the code
2. `Data_Dictionary.md`: Detailed information file about the features in the provided datasets
3. `AZDIAS_Feature_Summary.csv`: Summary of feature attributes for demographics data; 85 features (rows) x 4 columns
4. Not uploaded: `Udacity_AZDIAS_Subset.csv` (100MB+), which contains demographics data for the general population of Germany; 891211 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns). The other file is `Udacity_CUSTOMERS_Subset.csv`, which is confidential and contains demographics data for customers of a mail-order company; 191652 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns)
